# Chatbot Project 'Python-chatbot-test-N1'

This repository contains a simple Python chatbot that engages in a basic conversation with the user. The chatbot responds to predefined user inputs with corresponding messages.

## How to Run the Chatbot

To run the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.

3. Navigate to the directory where the "chatbot.py" file is located.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.

5. Type the following command to start the chatbot:

6. The chatbot will greet you with a message like "Chatbot: Hi there! How can I help you?" You can start typing your messages as the user input.

7. Type your message and press Enter. The chatbot will respond based on the predefined responses in the `responses` dictionary.

8. Continue chatting with the chatbot by entering different messages. If you want to exit the chat, simply type "exit" (case insensitive), and the chatbot will bid you goodbye and end the conversation.

## About the Project

This project is a simple demonstration of a console-based chatbot in Python. The chatbot's responses are predefined and randomly selected from a list of possible responses based on user input. It serves as a starting point for those interested in learning about chatbot development and natural language processing (NLP) concepts.
